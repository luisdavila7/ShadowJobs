Shadow Jobs Project

Shadow-Jobs, an application that offers a service for employers to match the employees needed, to cover their positions quickly and reliably. 
Shadow-Jobs is a service Customer to Customer, Students to Restaurants.


1.1.	The problem
In Montreal and around the world, there are many job opportunities that are not being taken advantage of because it does not reach the right user at the correct time. 
Currently the restaurant industry is at a critical time which they need to hire more people and even though there are people looking for this job the restaurants always lack employment. The first reason is this problem occurs is due to the lack of connection that exists between demand and supply, the communication channels that exist to be able to present a job offer at the last minute do not have sufficient scope to be able to reach the potential users. Second, because of Covid-19, governments launch a lot of aid for unemployed people , which completely covered their needs, and they did not feel the need to work. Finally, current regulations vary too much, preventing some employers from refraining from long-term hiring because they don't know when they can open their businesses , forcing them to hire last minute once they know reopening dates.

1.2.	The projectâ€™s scope.

The main objective is to make a Mobile application that connects restaurants with our target audience quickly and effectively to cover the lack of workers. ShadowJobs wants to make sure that the end user reaches the job at the correct time, this to help the end user get a job and finish with the problem of lack of employees. Our mission is to help students get more than a job, get passion. Our vision is that we see our application providing all types of end users all to end the lack of employees, around the world.
With Shadow-Jobs we will offer a platform in which Students will be able to register if they are Canadian with a proof of address, ID, and a proof that they are studying, if they are international students, we will ask for work permit and a proof that they are studying these proofs are given to them by the school. We are aware that these students have a limited schedule, and they need to start making some money, we will allow them to choose where and when to work to accommodate their schedules. Reducing the shortage of staff.

1.2.1.	Short term.
Our first market niche will be Montreal. Our first users will be the restaurants of the city and our first workers will be students that are legally able to work. We offer our connection services between users and restaurants through a web page, the modality of this idea is to work customer to customer (C2C) and that they can do match through the web platform.

1.2.2.	Mid-term goals
The mid-term goal is to develop a mobile application in which restaurants can apply for their vacancies and in such a way that students can find job opportunities.

1.2.3.	Long-term goals
The long-term goal is that the application also works for other types of jobs and that the scope is for all people who need to do an additional job or get a job.

1.3.	Background on the company
This idea was born because of the experiences of two of the Co-founders, who as international students lived the experience in a direct way. In his quest to land a part-time job, our Co-Founder went from corner to corner and from contact to contact looking for a job opportunity. This situation is very regular and shows the reality of many international students who are unable to find a job if they do not have the necessary contacts or friendships. It was very evident to notice the lack of employees in this sector, some restaurants with labor needs of 10 people to operate, but they do it with only 5 employees. Those restaurant owners decided to do this in their desire not to be economically affected or even go bankrupt, this is how they ask their few employees to help support the business.

1.4.	Current solutions and Competitors
Current solutions for students who arrived at Canada from another country or students' study at a CEGEP or University and decide to start working result in an inefficient and tedious process of recruitment even for a dishwasher job that is going to be temporary for the student, and most of the time they do not even get a response back
